# Hello

![Picture of me](media/me.jpg)

Hi, I'm Chris, and you've stumbled upon my wiki and blog. Originally from the
United States, I'm now located in the Netherlands with my wife SÃ©. I'm a
developer and digital explorer, currently working for
[Lunatech](https://www.lunatech.com). I primarily work in Scala and JavaScript
with a preference for simple tech and working on tooling.  I have a varied
background that includes growing up on a farm and earning an MA in International
Leadership, and even more varied interests that include cooking, sculpture,
wine, and space. If you have any questions about this site, my work, or just
want to say hello, feel free to reach out by any of the means below.
