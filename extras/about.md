# Hello

![Picture of me](/media/me.jpg)

Hi, I'm Chris, and you've stumbled upon my wiki and blog. This is a place where
I track my time worked on things, write articles abouts stuff I'm interested in,
and keep lists of things I want to find again. Originally from the United
States, I'm now located in the Netherlands with my wife SÃ©. I'm a developer and
digital explorer, currently working for [Lunatech
Labs](https://www.lunatech.com). I primarily work in Scala and JavaScript with a
preference for simple tech and tooling. I have a varied background that includes
growing up on a farm and earning an MA in International Relations, and even more
varied interests that include cooking, sculpture, and wine.

Just to help make sense of this site, it consists of two parts. First being the
blog, which is pretty self explanatory. Second is the wiki. A few years ago I
was intrigued by various others I saw that were keeping wiki's and time trackers
as a way to track what they have been working on. This project turned into what
I call [chronica](/wiki/chronica), and is intertwined with this site. At the top
of the site you'll see a graph detailing my productivity from when I've started
this project almost 3 years ago. On each wiki page you'll see a breakdown of
what type of activity I was working on while tracking time for that topic, and
at the bottom of the page you'll see tags for related topics. Not all tags have
entries. This website is automatically updated daily, and you can read more
about how it works [here](https://chris-kipp.io/blog/how-is-this-site-built).

If you have any questions about this site, my work, or just want to say hello,
feel free to reach out by any of the means below.
