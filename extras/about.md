# Hello

![Picture of me](media/me.jpg)

Hi, I'm Chris, and you've stumbled upon my wiki. Originally from the United
States, I'm now located in the Netherlands with my wife SÃ©. I'm a developer and
digital explorer, currently working for [Lunatech](https://www.lunatech.com). I
primarily work in Scala and JavaScript with a preference for functional
programming. I have a varied background that includes growing up on a farm and
earning an MA in International Leadership, and even more varied interests that
include cooking, sculpture, wine, and space. If you have any questions about
this site, my work, or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out by any of
the means below.

Thanks for visiting, and enjoy your exploring.

Chris
