# Hello

![Picture of me](/media/me.jpg)

Hi, I'm Chris, and you've stumbled upon my wiki and blog. This is a place where
I track my time worked on things, write articles abouts stuff I'm interested in,
and keep lists of things I want to find again. Originally from the United
States, I'm now located in the Netherlands with my wife SÃ©. I'm a developer and
digital explorer, currently working for [Lunatech
Labs](https://www.lunatech.com). I primarily work in Scala and JavaScript with a
preference for simple tech and tooling.  I have a varied background that
includes growing up on a farm and earning an MA in International Leadership, and
even more varied interests that include cooking, sculpture, wine, and space. If
you have any questions about this site, my work, or just want to say hello, feel
free to reach out by any of the means below.
