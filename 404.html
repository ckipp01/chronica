    wiki.chronica currently only works with JS enabled. I'm in the
    process of creating an alternative for my wiki to also have an option to
    provide the same experience without JS. All JS is being used to only render
    my site. You can view the source <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ckipp01/wiki.chronica">here</a>

  <script>
    const path = window.location.pathname.split("/")
    const target = path[path.length -1]
    document.location.href = `/#${target}`
