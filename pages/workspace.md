As soon as I started developing I became interested in making sure the machine I
was working on for at least 8 hours a day felt pleasant to look at and worked
well. I'm amazed at the amount of ways you can tweak your machine and tools to
work for you and to look the way you want. If not, then you can also freely
build your own.
