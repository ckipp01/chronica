# javascript

When I first started learning programming, JavaScript was my introduction into
what was really possible with programming. It's the language I currently feel
most comfortable with and have the most experience with. In the last year say my
JS has changed to a more functional style favoring immutability, pure functions,
and higher order functions. This came as a result of working with Scala in my
day job.

Below I've listed a few resources that have really helped me with JavaScript and
that I'd recommend to anyone.

  - [Composing Software - Eric
    Elliot](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/composing-software-the-book-f31c77fc3ddc)
    This series is one of my all time favorites. It introduces a lot of
    functional programming concepts in an easy to understand manner with a ton
    of examples. It also explains a lot of why the functional paradigm is
    important not just in JavaScript, but programming in general.
  - [You-Don't-Know-JS - Kyle
    Simpson](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) Kyle Simpson's series
    YDKJS really layed the foundation for me in terms of knowledge and
    understanding. This is probably the best overview and study of the JS
    language that you'll find.
