# bash

```scala mdoc:percentages:bash
```
Bash is currently my go to shell. I've worked with zsh and tcsh (forcefully) in
the past, and I've always come Back to bash. I plan to stay with bash until I
hit a point where I'm frustrated with the limits of what it has to other verse
other shells. I don't see that happening any time soon, so I'll probably be with
bash for quite some time

Below I've listed a few resources/libraries that I commonly use with bash and
have had a good experience with.

  - [patetoy](https://github.com/loliee/patatetoy) is a minimal prompt that I
    used for bash and really enjoyed.
  - [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) is a great tool that I use to
    easily jump to a specific directory.
  - [bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion) which provide and
  - auto-completion experience similar to what a lot of people switch to zsh
    for.
