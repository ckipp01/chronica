# Network

```scala mdoc:percentages:network
```
This project is sort of a catch all that should've been created a long time ago.
I currently have a server that is running a few databases that store logs for
[Ã¡ndaga](/andaga) and also records from [waka-fetch](/waka-fetch). I'm also in
the process of degoogling as much as I'm able to. Part of that process is to get
rid of google drive. I'm currently in process of doing so by a self-hosted
[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) with [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com) data
storage. In the future, I'll have a full writeup of my entire network setup."
