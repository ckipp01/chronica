# [joh](https://github.com/ckipp01/joh)

```scala mdoc:percentages:joh
```

joh is currently very much a work in progress. When completed, joh will take in
a json schema file and produce a static html page of that schema in order to
better visualize the json data structures that we often create in teams. In my
experience this helps others easily understand your schema without having to dig
through your code.
