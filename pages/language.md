# language

This project is an ongoing one. I studied Spanish for 6 years when younger,
studied in Mexico and Costa Rica, and then slowly watched the language dwindle
away in my mind. I've studied some Turkish and spent 4 months traveling around
Turkey. I was amazed at the amount of language one can learn in a short amount
of time when forced to speak it and focused. I also started studying Korean when
I met my wife and regularly take trips there.

In July of 2018 I moved to the Netherlands, so any current activity on language
learning for the time being will probably be Dutch
