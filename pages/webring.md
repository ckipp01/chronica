"You may have noticed the middle icon in the footer of this site. It leads to a
[webring](https://webring.xxiivv.com) full of wikis, portfolios, and the likes.
The creativity and talent you'll find browsing around on the various sites is
astounding. I'm grateful to be part of the community."

I'm one of the maintainers of the webring and am passionate about exploring
alternatives to the current ways we communicate online. I believe decentralizing
our social channels and owning our data is important. The webring consists of a
traditional webring, but also a few other non-traditional parts. [The
Hallway](https://webring.xxiivv.com/hallway.html) is a web client utilizing
decentralized [twtxt](https://github.com/buckket/twtxt) feeds to communicate.
[The Wiki](https://webring.xxiivv.com/wiki.html) is a accumulated wiki from
decentralized [Indental](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/oscean.html) feeds.

I've also built multiple tools around the webring ecosystem such as the
[webring-checker](/webring-checker) and the [webring-cli](/webring-cli)
