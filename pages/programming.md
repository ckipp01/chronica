# programming

> Sometimes, the elegant implementation is just a function. Not a method. Not a class. Not a framework. Just a function.
 ~John Carmack"

I'm a self-taught programmer that started programming out of a curiosity. It
didn't take long for me to completely fall in love with the idea of being able
to create what I could envision. I consider myself a developer that enjoys
working both with front and back end technologies. I dabble in everything that I
can get my hands on. I enjoy writing scripts, improving development process, and
helping lower the barriers to tech. Professionally I work primarily in
JavaScript and Scala, but you can get a picture of the languages and focuses by
peaking at the tags tab. This category is sort of a catch all to all things
related to programming that don't fall into a specific other category."
