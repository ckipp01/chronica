# scripts

```scala mdoc:percentages:scripts
```

Writing small scripts to accomplish tasks is one of my favorite things to do. If
I find myself doing something multiple times in a row, my mind always questions
how I can automate the process. Most of the scripts I've written are in bash and
solve pretty specific problems that I've encountered.

```scala mdoc:tags:scripts
```
