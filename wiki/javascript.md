# javascript

When I first started learning programming, JavaScript was my introduction into
what was really possible with programming. I built a lot of small little
projects with it that taught me a ton. The ability to get up and running
quickly, and the ability to pretty much run anywhere is such a great thing for
newcomers. I'll also enjoy tinkering around with JS even if I don't use it on a
daily basis anymore.

Below I've listed a few resources that have really helped me with JavaScript and
that I'd recommend to anyone.

  - [Composing Software - Eric Elliot](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/composing-software-the-book-f31c77fc3ddc)
    This series is one of my all time favorites. It introduces a lot of
    functional programming concepts in an easy to understand manner with a ton
    of examples. It also explains a lot of why the functional paradigm is
    important not just in JavaScript, but programming in general.
  - [You-Don't-Know-JS - Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) Kyle Simpson's series
    YDKJS really layed the foundation for me in terms of knowledge and
    understanding. This is probably the best overview and study of the JS
    language that you'll find.
