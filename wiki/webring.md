I'm one of the maintainers of the [xxiivv webring](https://webring.xxiivv.com/)
and am passionate about exploring alternatives to the current ways we
communicate online. I believe decentralizing our social channels and owning our
data is important. The webring consists of a traditional webring, but also a few
other non-traditional parts. [The
Hallway](https://webring.xxiivv.com/hallway.html) is a web client utilizing
decentralized [twtxt](https://github.com/buckket/twtxt) feeds to communicate.
[The Wiki](https://webring.xxiivv.com/wiki.html) is a accumulated wiki from
decentralized [Indental](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/oscean.html) feeds.

I've also built multiple tools around the webring ecosystem such as the
[webring-checker](webring-checker.html) and the [webring-cli](webring-cli.html)
