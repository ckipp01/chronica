# xxiivv webring


```scala mdoc:percentages:webring
```

I used to be one of the maintainers of the xxiivv webring. It was a great
project about exploring alternatives to the current ways we communicate online.
I believe that decentralizing our social channels and owning our data is
important. The webring consisted of a traditional webring, but also a few other
non-traditional parts.  The Hallway which was a web client utilizing
decentralized [twtxt](https://github.com/buckket/twtxt) feeds to communicate and
The Wiki, which was an accumulated wiki from decentralized
[Indental](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/oscean.html) feeds. The webring has
since turned more into a tradition webring, which I'm no longer a part of.

I've also built multiple tools around the webring ecosystem such as the
[webring-checker](/wiki/webring-checker) and the
[webring-cli](/wiki/webring-cli), which are both archived.
