```scala mdoc:percentages:chronica

[chronica](https://chronica.xyz) is the name that I'm using for the ecosystem of
logs, writing, and art that I've produced. Currently the wiki is the main focus,
but eventually you'll see a blog portion and also a portion displaying
generative art.

The main reason for chronica is to provide a unified place for things I've
created. I really wanted a place for my logs to be displayed, but I also wanted
a place to do a bit of writing. I soon realized that many of the ideas that I
had were all sort of related, but also deserved to be in their own little
worlds. Hence, chronica.

I also must give credit where credit is due. Below are a few sites that I
recommend and that have highly influenced chronica.

  - [wiki.xxiivv.com](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#home) Devine has radically
    changed the way I think about development. His philosophy and approach to
    development has taught me that it's ok to go against he grain and to simply
    create. His ecosystem of tools are a testimony of productivity and
    creativity that in my opinion flies in the face of many modern day trends.
  - [avenier.now.sh](https://avanier.now.sh) Josh's pursuit of functional
    minimalism (my interpretation of his work) inspires me to ignore the noise
    and focus on what matters.
  - [macwright.org](https://macwright.org) Tom's site is a reminder that I don't
    have to settle for giant sites full of trackers and adds to find quality
    content.
