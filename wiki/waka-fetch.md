```scala mdoc:percentages:waka-fetch
```

waka-fetch is a small serverless app hosted on [Zeit](https://zeit.co) that
grabs my daily [wakatime](https://wakatime.com) summaries. I grab these
summaries and store them in a MongoDB database. I grab them in order to feed
them into my [waka-machine](waka-machine.html) project will gives me projections on
what my coding activity will look like in the week to come.

```scala mdoc:tags:waka-fetch
```
