```scala mdoc:percentages:waka-fetch
```

waka-fetch is a small serverless app hosted on [Zeit](https://zeit.co) that
grabs my daily [wakatime](https://wakatime.com) summaries. I grab these
summaries and store them in a MongoDB database. Originally I grabbed them in
order to feed them into my [waka-machine](waka-machine.html) project which would
give me projections on what my coding activity will look like in the week to
come. Now, I just store them in hopes that someday I'll think of a cool way to
display the data.

```scala mdoc:tags:waka-fetch
