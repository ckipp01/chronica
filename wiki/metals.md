```scala mdoc:percentages:metals
```

[metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/) is language server for the Scala
Programming language. It's been an absolute pleasure to be part of this team.
I'm a regular contributor to this project and wrote the
[coc-metals](https://github.com/scalameta/coc-metals) Vim client, and have been
working on the [nvim-metals](/wiki/nvim-metals) plugin for those seeking to have
an LSP experience natively in Nvim.

This project has been one of the first tooling projects that I've gotten
involved with, and for many reasons it has caused me to be more and more
interested in the world of developer [tooling](/wiki/tooling). The entire
[Scalameta ](https://scalameta.org/) project is brilliant. The organization
holds a ton of great libraries like [scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/),
[mdoc](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/), [MUnit](https://scalameta.org/munit/), and
more.
