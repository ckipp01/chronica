```scala mdoc:percentages:metals
```

[metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/) is language server for the Scala
Programming language. It's been an absolute pleasure to be part of this team.
I'm a regular contributor to this project and have written the official
[coc-metals](https://github.com/scalameta/coc-metals) vim client.

This project has been one of the first tooling projects that I've gotten
involved with, and for many reasons it has caused me to be more and more
interested in the world of [tooling](tooling.html). The entire [Scalameta
](https://scalameta.org/) project is brilliant. The organization holds a ton of
great libraries like [scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/),
[mdoc](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/), [MUnit](https://scalameta.org/munit/), and
more.
