# processing

```scala mdoc:percentages:processing
```

[Processing](https://processing.org) is something quite new to me. I've been
really amazed at what people have created using libraries like
[p5.js](http://p5js.org) and am really interested in the intersection of coding
and art.

As I become more familiar with this, you'll see more info here. Eventually I'll
also have a works.chronica section of chronica that will showcase some of the
things I've created.

```scala mdoc:tags:processing
```
