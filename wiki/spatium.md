# spatium

> The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself

Spatium is heavily a work in a progress and probably will be for quite some time
as it's much heavier in research than the rest of my projects.

I've been intrigued by space for a long time, but have never dove in as deep as
I'd like to. In this season I've been curious about the intersection of my
interests, and I'm taking this opportunity to combine a curiosity about
astronomy and my love for coding to create Spatium. Spatium will be a series of
writings and simulations surrounding astronomical concepts. My plan is to learn
them, and then illustrate them.
