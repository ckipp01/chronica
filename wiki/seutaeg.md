This is in the very early stages of development. Currently for [gyul](gyul.html) I
use file called crate.js, which is just a big JS object, to hold all of the main
data and content for my site. As I'm looking to also use [gyul](gyul.html) for
longer writing, which means this needs to change. It's not the most human
readable format.

The current plan is to have the file be a tabular file that is more human
readable. There will also be a parsing library involved that will be able to
parse patterns and symbols to quickly create links, bold text, etc.

This idea is heavily inspired by [Indental](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#indental)
and [Runic](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#runic). Both of these are built by Devine
Lu Linvega.
