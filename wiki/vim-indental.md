Indental is a creation of [Devine's](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/oscean.html)
that is used a space-senstive, human readable text database format. I was
originally intrigued by it since the parser is a mere 50ish lines of code. It
allowed for easy to read key-value and list storage. It's also the format that
the [Webring Wiki](https://webring.xxiivv.com/wiki.html) uses. I store a lot of
information this way, and was yearning for some type of syntax highlighting. One
thing led to another, and vim-indental was born. It's very much a work in
progress, but it has also served as a great way for me to learn about vim
plugins.
