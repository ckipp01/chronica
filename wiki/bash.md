# bash

Bash was my go to shell for quite some time. Before Bash I worked with zsh and
tcsh (forcefully) in the past, and I've always came Back to bash. I always
mentioned that I planned on staying with Bash until I reached a point where I
"hit the wall" per se and needed something else. I have actually switch off bash
to [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/), not necessarily because  bash didn't
give me what I needed, but because of the sheer amount of customization needed
to achieve the same experience I get with fish.

Below I've listed a few resources/libraries that I commonly used with bash and
have had a good experience with.

  - [patetoy](https://github.com/loliee/patatetoy) is a minimal prompt that I
    used for bash and really enjoyed.
  - [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) is a great tool that I use to
    easily jump to a specific directory.
  - [bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion) which provide and
  - auto-completion experience similar to what a lot of people switch to zsh
    for.
