# talks

```scala mdoc:percentages:talks
```

When I have the opportunity, and when I feel like I actually have something to
share, I enjoy being able to present on topics I have experience with, or things
I've been diving into. I've found that at times giving a talk on a subject is
one of the best ways to dive into that subject. Below you can find a few talks
that I've given.

- [Scala Development with Vim in 2020](/presentations/slides-vim-scala-2020)
- [A Zero to Hero Vim + Metals setup for Scala](/presentations/slides-zero-to-hero)
- [How Metals and LSP allow you to use your favorite editor for
    Scala](/presentations/slides-lsp-metals)
- [Demystifying serverless functions with Zeit Now](/presentations/slides-faas-zeit-now)

```scala mdoc:tags:talks
