# tooling

```scala mdoc:percentages:tooling
```

In the last year, much of my free time has been spent on the topic of tooling. I
regularly work on [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/), and various Vim LSP
plugins for Metals, and am fascinated by the tooling world. As a developer
tooling is something I rub up against daily, and it always seems that tooling
leaves one of two impressions:

- I hate this
- I love this

I hope to be able to contribute to the _I love this_ side of that impression. I
hope to continue to learn and dive further into the world of tooling. This topic
is meant to track all research and general work in that area.

```scala mdoc:tags:tooling
