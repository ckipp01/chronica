# tooling

```scala mdoc:percentages:tooling
```

I have a sort of fascination with programming tooling. Partly because it's
something as a developer I use so much, but also something that seemingly hasn't
really made that many changes in the past years. I think this is an area ripe
for improvements and innovation.

Since I primarily work with JavaScript and Scala, my focus is in these two
ecosystems. Recently I've been studying about the [Language Server
Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol), and been
working on [metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/).

```scala mdoc:tags:tooling
```
