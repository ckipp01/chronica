```scala mdoc:percentages:coc-metals
```

coc-metals is a [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) extension for
[Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals), the Scala language Server. It was one of
the first full projects that I built in the tooling world, and showed me how I
could be part of bettering the developer experience for a language.

He may not know it, but this project wouldn't have happened if [Ólafur Páll
Geirsson](https://twitter.com/olafurpg) didn't spend the time chatting with me
about it, and helping me get started in the Metals ecosystem. So thank you.
